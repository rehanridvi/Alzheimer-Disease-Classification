# Alzheimer-Disease-Classification
This project focuses on identifying the stages of Alzheimer’s disease, a neurodegenerative condition that profoundly affects memory and cognitive functions. Timely detection and categorization of these stages are vital for effective treatment and intervention. By utilizing computational models, the project analyzes patient data to make precise predictions about disease stages, ultimately enhancing diagnostic processes and supporting medical professionals.

#Outcome:
The models show varying performance on the dataset, with Decision Tree  achieving an accuracy of 87.44%, indicating the best classification results. Logistic Regression follows closely with 84.03% accuracy, demonstrating strong performance for probabilistic classification. KNN, with 73,48% accuracy, performs decently but slightly lags behind the other two, possibly due to overfitting or underfitting. Overall, Decision Tree outperforms the other models, while Logistic Regression remains a strong contender, and KNN shows room for improvement. The confusion matrices can provide deeper insights into misclassifications, but accuracy-wise, Decision Tree stands as the most reliable model.
